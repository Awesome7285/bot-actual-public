Both players must hit the ball with the cue like a golf club for their next turn
Remove one of the holes
Both players must play with only the top half of the pool cue
Both players must use the end of the pool cue
Both players must do their next move sitting on the table
Revert to neither player being stripes or solids as if no ball had been sunk
Both players must agree on an edge to make the winning edge, (an edge between each hole) if any ball touches this edge, it gets removed like it had been sunk (if both players canâ€™t agree, Tom must decide, if Tom is not there, then Oscar must decide)
It's now regular pool
All even balls apart from 8 are removed
Put a pool cue over the middle of the pool table lining up with the holes
Tom comes outta nowhere and does something
Both players must use the shame stick for this turn
Remove all balls except the black ball
The white ball now acts as the black ball, and the black ball now acts as the white ball
Both players may remove one of their opponents balls
Both players may remove one of their own balls
Find an object and get a third party to place it randomly in the board for the rest of the game (If there's no convenient object, use the triangle)
The game rules now change, either player wins if they hit the black ball off the table (and all other balls are ignored)
Use Oscars chalk for the next shot
All balls become black balls
Both players must grab a chalk and place it somewhere on the board (the chalk cannot be removed for the test of the game)
All balls are scrambled!
All boards are steamrolled (to the white's starting point edge)
All odd numbered balls are removed
Both players must choose somebody else to play for them
Each player gets 2 of the opponents balls, 'in hand'
If Tyler is playing, he loses
